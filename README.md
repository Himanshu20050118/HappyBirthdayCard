# 🎂 Happy Birthday Card App

**A modern Android application built with Jetpack Compose to celebrate special moments.**

---

## 📱 About The App

This project is a demonstration of **modern Android development** using declarative UI. It displays a customized birthday greeting card featuring a festive background image and styled typography. It serves as a perfect example of how to layer composables using `Box`, `Column`, and `Row` layouts.

**Key Features:**

* 🎉 **Immersive UI**: Full-screen background image with overlay content.
* 🎨 **Custom Styling**: Large, bold typography with specific font sizing and line heights.
* 🌗 **Theme Aware**: Built on Material3 foundation.
* 🧩 **Composable Architecture**: Clean separation of UI components (`GreetingText`, `GreetingImage`).

## 💡 Code Highlights

Here is how the main card composition is structured using `Box` to layer text over an image:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun GreetingImage(message: String, from: String, modifier: Modifier = Modifier) {
    val image = painterResource(R.drawable.androidparty)
    
    // Box allows stacking elements on top of each other
    Box(modifier) {
        Image(
            painter = image,
            contentDescription = null,
            contentScale = ContentScale.Crop,
            alpha = 0.5f // Adds a subtle transparency
        )
        GreetingText(
            message = message,
            from = from,
            modifier = Modifier
                .fillMaxSize()
                .padding(8.dp)
        )
    }
}

```
